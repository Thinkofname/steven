# Steven (Rust)

A Minecraft client coded in Rust. Ported from [steven-go](https://github.com/Thinkofname/steven).
Don't expect it to go anywhere, just doing this for fun.

## Building
For more detailed info and platform specific instructions check the [wiki](https://github.com/Thinkofname/steven-rust/wiki/Compiling-and-or-running).

Currently requires SDL2, OpenSSL and **nighly** rust to build.

`cargo build --release`

Windows users can download pre-compiled builds from here: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/thinkofdeath/steven-rust
(Select your platform, Click the artifacts tab and download Steven.zip)

The Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable is required to run these builds.

## Running

### Standalone

Just running steven via a double click (Windows) or `./steven` (everything else)
will bring up a login screen followed by a server list which you can select a server
from.

### Via the Offical Minecraft launcher

Currently not supported (yet)
